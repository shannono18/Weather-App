##WeatherDashboard

Deployed application: https://shannono18.github.io/Weather-App/

This application uses the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to allow users to search current weather conditions as well as a 5 day forecast when I search by city name. Previous cities users have searched for are displayed from local storage and are easily clickable on the lefthand side of the screen.
